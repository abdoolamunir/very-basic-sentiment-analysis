# very-basic-sentiment-analysis
RESTful API using FastAPI that utilizes a pre-trained Hugging Face Transformer model to perform text classification (sentiment analysis, emotion classification, etc). The API is containerized using Docker. It's all very basic.
This document provides instructions for building, running, and interacting with the FastAPI application for sentiment analysis.

Features
Analyzes sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of provided text.
Leverages pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Hub.
Exposes an API endpoint for easy integration.
Uses FastAPI for a clean and efficient API design.
Requirements
Python 3.8 or later
Docker installed
Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repository_name>.git
cd <your_repository_name>
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Install dependencies:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Building the Docker Image
Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:

Bash
docker build -t sentiment-analysis-api .
Use code with caution.
content_copy
This will create a Docker image named sentiment-analysis-api.

Running the Container
Run the Docker container, exposing port 8000 for the API:

Bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 sentiment-analysis-api
Use code with caution.
content_copy
This will start the container and make the API accessible at http://localhost:8000.

Interacting with the API
The API provides a single endpoint for sentiment analysis:

POST /analyze: Send a JSON request with the following key:
text: The text you want to analyze (string)
Example request:

JSON
{
  "text": "This is a great product!"
}
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Example response:

JSON
{
  "result": [
    {
      "label": "POSITIVE",
      "score": 0.98
    }
  ]
}
Use code with caution.
content_copy
The response includes an array of sentiment predictions. Each prediction has a label (POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL) and a score representing the confidence level (between 0 and 1).

Additional Information:

You can explore the API using tools like Postman or by directly sending requests from your code.
The FastAPI application automatically generates interactive documentation (Swagger UI) accessible at http://localhost:8000/docs.
